This case tests digsig, available from http://www.sf.net/projects/disec.
You may install digsig by hand, or automatically install the latest
version using builddigsig.sh.

Currently there are two tests:
	1. Test for exclusive mmap(execute)+open(write) access.
	2. Test for which bytes can be modified in a signed executable.

These tests require
	1. /usr/local/bin/bsign
	2. A 2.6 kernel
		a. With LSM enabled
			(CONFIG_SECURITY)
		b. With no other security modules loaded
			boot with append="selinux=0 capability.disable=1"

Steps to run tests:

	1. Download and build digsig:
		sh ./builddigsig.sh
	2. Compile tests:
		make all
	3. Run the tests
		sh ./test.sh

The results will be in:
	twiddlebit/digsigoutput
	twiddlebit/bsignoutput
	writeexec/weoutput
