  This page describes how to compile your applications and run them on tmlinux.

==Preparation:== 
  === 1. Get and install TCS Linux edition.===

  First of all, you should install TCS Linux edition on your Linux machines. Please goto [http://www.tcshelp.com] to get it. Of course, you should have the license for it. 
  In the following section, let's support the installation directory of your TCS is _*/opt/NXP/TCS510/*_ 

  === 2. Checkout sysroots from this project's svn.===
  Now make your work directory (suppose it is _*/home/guohr/worktest/*_), at this directory, use the following command to get the sysroots:
  {{{
cd /home/guohr/worktest/
svn checkout http://tmlinux.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sysroots/
  }}}
  === 3. Setup application building environment.===
  Make sure the TCS tools(such as tmcc, tmld) in the PATH environment and the compiler for your application building in the PATH environment.
  {{{
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/NXP/TCS510/bin/
export PATH=$PATH:/home/guohr/worktest/sysroots/pnx1500_ttisim_uclibc/x86-linux2/
  }}}
  
  To validate the environment, at shell, use the following command, the result will like this:
  {{{
guohr@ghr-notebook-02:~/worktest/tmlinux-app> tmcc -V
tmcc: V7.1.0 of TCS V5.1(0042rc6_Linux)
tmcc warning : no work
  }}}
  {{{
guohr@ghr-notebook-02:~/worktest/tmlinux-app>trimedia-gss-linux-tcs-pnx1500el_fp64-uclibc-gcc -V
tmcc: V7.1.0 of TCS V5.1(0042rc6_Linux)
tmcc warning : no work
  }}}
  === 4. Create TCS environment for building your applications.===
  To create the whole TCS environment for building tmlinux applications, you need to goto *_sysroots/sysroots/pnx1500_ttisim_uclibc/tcs/5.1.0_* and then use the following command:
  {{{
cd /home/guohr/worktest/tmlinux-app/sysroots/pnx1500_ttisim_uclibc/tcs/5.1.0
TCS=/opt/NXP/TCS510 ./creat-tcs.sh
  }}}
  Please set TCS with your TCS installation path (In the above example, it is *_/opt/NXP/TCS510_*).
