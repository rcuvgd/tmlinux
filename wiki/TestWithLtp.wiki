= Introduction =

This page describes how to test tmlinux using LTP. The Linux™ Test Project (LTP) is a joint project started by SGI™ and maintained by IBM®, that has a goal to deliver test suites to the open source community that validate the reliability, robustness, and stability of Linux. The LTP testsuite contains a collection of tools for testing the Linux kernel and related features. For more information, please goto http://ltp.sourceforge.net


= Details =

==1. checkout LTP==
checkout LTP using the following command:
{{{
svn checkout http://tmlinux.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ltp-base
}}}

Let's suppose you checkout ltp-base at *_/home/guohr/workdir/tmlinux/ltp-base_*

==2. Set compiler and PATH environment==
Edit *_Makefile_* at *_/home/guohr/workdir/tmlinux/ltp-base/_* and set CROSS_COMPILE as the compiler prefix you are using.

For PNX1500 nohost, you should set CROSS_COMPIL as *_trimedia-gss-linux-tcs-pnx1500el_fp64-uclibc-_*

And then set PATH environment variable, so that shell can find the compiler you are using.
For PNX1500 nohost, you should set PATH using the following command:
{{{
export PATH=$PATH:/home/guohr/workdir/tmlinux/sysroots/pnx1500_nohost_uclibc/x86-linux2/
}}}

==3. Build and Install LTP==
Now build and install ltp using the following commands:
{{{
cd /home/guohr/workdir/tmlinux/ltp-base
make uclinux
sudo make uclinux_install
}}}
