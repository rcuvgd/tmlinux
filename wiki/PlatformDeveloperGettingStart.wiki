= Introduction =

This page describes how to compile the whole platform of tmlinux (includding linux kernel, uclibc and so on) and how to populate sysroot for application developer.

==Preparation==
===0. Environment setup==
In the following section, let's suppose the workdir is _*/home/guohr/worktest*_ and the TCS installation directory is _*/opt/NXP/TCS510*_
 
===1. Get and Install TCS Linux edition===
First of all, you should install TCS Linux edition on your Linux machines. Please goto [http://www.tcshelp.com] to get it. Of course, you should have the license for it. 
In the following section, let's suppose the installation directory of your TCS is _*/opt/NXP/TCS510/*_

===2. Install CIL (C intermedia language)===
Note that: before continuing, you need to make sure you have installed OCaml language compiler. OCaml can be downloaded from http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/. After downloading and unpacking the source distribution, in the ocaml directory, do:
  {{{
./configure
make world
make opt
make install
  }}}

Before building Linux kernel image, you need to setup and install cil in your Linux machine, which is used to process GNU C extension options when compiling Linux kernel.
  
Use the following command to check it out and compile, setup it.
  {{{
svn checkout http://tmlinux.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cil
cd cil/
./configure
make  
export PATH=$PATH:/home/guohr/worktest/cil/obj/x86_LINUX/
  }}}

To validate the environment, type the following command and you will get the following message:
{{{
guohr@ghr-notebook-01:~/worktest/cil> cilly.asm.exe

Error: No arguments for CIL

Fatal error: exception Errormsg.Error
}}}
