= Introduction =

This page describes how to compile the whole platform of tmlinux (includding linux kernel, uclibc and so on) and how to populate sysroot for application developer.

= Details =

==Preparation==
===0. Environment setup==
In the following section, let's suppose the workdir is _*/home/guohr/worktest*_ and the TCS installation directory is _*/opt/NXP/TCS510*_
 
===1. Get and Install TCS Linux edition===
First of all, you should install TCS Linux edition on your Linux machines. Please goto [http://www.tcshelp.com] to get it. Of course, you should have the license for it. 
In the following section, let's suppose the installation directory of your TCS is _*/opt/NXP/TCS510/*_

To make sure the TCS tools(such as tmcc, tmld) are in the PATH environment
  {{{
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/NXP/TCS510/bin/
  }}}
  {{{
guohr@ghr-notebook-02:~/worktest> tmcc -V
tmcc: V7.1.0 of TCS V5.1(0042rc6_Linux)
tmcc warning : no work
  }}}


===2. Install CIL (C intermedia language)===
Note that: before continuing, you need to make sure you have installed OCaml language compiler. OCaml can be downloaded from http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/. After downloading and unpacking the source distribution, in the ocaml directory, do:
  {{{
./configure
make world
make opt
make install
  }}}

Before building Linux kernel image, you need to setup and install cil in your Linux machine, which is used to process GNU C extension options when compiling Linux kernel.
  
Use the following command to check it out and compile, setup it.
  {{{
svn checkout http://tmlinux.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cil
cd cil/
./configure
make  
export PATH=$PATH:/home/guohr/worktest/cil/obj/x86_LINUX/
  }}}

To validate the environment, type the following command and you will get the following message:
{{{
guohr@ghr-notebook-01:~/worktest/cil> cilly.asm.exe

Error: No arguments for CIL

Fatal error: exception Errormsg.Error
}}}

==Build Linux Kernel==
===1. checkout Linux kernel of tmlinux===
*Note that:*
Due to the limit of max upload size of google code, I put the Linux kernel of tmlinux to [http://www.gulessoft.com/en/compay/contribution/125.html gulessoft official site] and will move to this project site as soon as google increase the limit.

Download Linux kernel of tmlinux using the following command: (DO NOT forget to verify it using md5sum)
{{{
wget -c http://www.gulessoft.com/download/tmlinux/linux-2.6.14-tmlinux-1.0.tar.bz2 
}}}

Unpack the Linux kernel
{{{
tar xvfjp linux-2.6.14-tmlinux-1.0.tar.bz2
mv linux-2.6.14-tmlinux-1.0 linux
}}}

===2. Configure Linux kernel===
*Note that:* Because of lacking storage device, I have to put the root filesystem into RAM using *initramfs* mechanism. So you have to arrange the root filesystem correctly, or else the kernel image can not load the `init` program as you want. About more details of initramfs, please refer the files in *_Documentation/early-userspace/_* of linux kernel source distribution.

===3. Build Linux kernel===

==Build uClibc==
==Generate sysroot==
