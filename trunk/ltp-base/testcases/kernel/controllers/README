The complete dir tree is for testcases for resource management testing of linux kernel.
For the test plan please refer to the file testplan.txt

--------------
***WARNING:***
--------------
The test creates the cpu controller device as /dev/cpuctl. In case you already have
/dev/cpuctl it may be overwritten. So please rename it to have a backup of your file.


FILES DESCRIPTION:

testplan.txt
------------
A brief description of the plan for resource management testing.

test_controllers.sh
-------------------
This is the main script file that starts the test. It first checks if the
controllers are enabled. If not enabled then it will not run the test and
will exit giving warning.

README
------
This file.

cpuctl
------
Directory containing the cpu controller testcases. A similar directory will be created for
any new controller.

memctl
------
Directory containing the memory controller testcases. A similar directory will
be created for any new controller.

libcontrollers
--------------
This directory contains the library for cpucontroller testing.

Makefile
--------
The usual Makefile to conduct all the tests.

Before starting compilation this file checks if the kernel is supporting the cpu controller.
If yes it enters lower directory and compiles the source files otherwise exits warning to user.
Hence the user has to take care of the fact that the test runs or just quiets.
(Your kernel needs to be 2.6.24 onwards with proper config options)

A snapshot of config file options is given below:
CONFIG_CGROUPS=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_DEBUG=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_NS=y
CONFIG_CPUSETS=y
CONFIG_GROUP_SCHED=y
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED=y
CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED=y
# CONFIG_USER_SCHED is not set
CONFIG_CGROUP_SCHED=y
